To create an automatic watering system for flowers using the VisionFive 2 RISC-V computer, you can follow a similar setup to the Raspberry Pi project. However, the VisionFive 2 has some differences in GPIO control, so here’s an adapted guide.

### 1. **Materials Needed**
   - VisionFive 2 RISC-V computer (running a Linux OS like Debian or Ubuntu)
   - Soil moisture sensor module
   - Relay module (for controlling the water pump)
   - Small water pump (5V or 12V)
   - Tubing for water flow to plants
   - Jumper wires
   - Power supply for the pump, if required

### 2. **Setting Up Hardware**
   - **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Connect the moisture sensor to the VisionFive 2 to detect dryness in the soil.
     - **VCC** on the sensor to **3.3V** (VisionFive GPIO operates at 3.3V instead of 5V).
     - **GND** to **GND**.
     - **OUT (Signal)** to **GPIO Pin X**, where **X** corresponds to an available GPIO pin on VisionFive 2 (e.g., `GPIO 12`).
   
   - **Relay Module and Water Pump**: Connect the relay to control the pump circuit.
     - **VCC** on the relay to **3.3V**.
     - **GND** to **GND**.
     - **IN** to **GPIO Pin Y** (e.g., `GPIO 13`).
     - Connect **COM** and **NO** terminals of the relay to the power source and water pump to control water flow.

### 3. **Install GPIO Library for VisionFive 2**
   Since VisionFive 2 uses RISC-V architecture, make sure your OS supports `gpio` control through libraries like `libgpiod`. Install `libgpiod` with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install gpiod libgpiod-dev
   ```

### 4. **Python Code for Automatic Watering**

   Here’s an example Python script, `watering_system_visionfive2.py`, using `gpiod` for GPIO control on VisionFive 2.

   ```python
   import gpiod
   import time

   # Define GPIO chip and lines (adjust based on pin mappings)
   SOIL_MOISTURE_PIN = 12  # GPIO for moisture sensor
   RELAY_PIN = 13          # GPIO for relay control

   # Initialize GPIO lines
   chip = gpiod.Chip('gpiochip0')  # Adjust chip if necessary
   soil_moisture_line = chip.get_line(SOIL_MOISTURE_PIN)
   relay_line = chip.get_line(RELAY_PIN)

   # Request lines
   soil_moisture_line.request(consumer="Soil Moisture Sensor", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_IN)
   relay_line.request(consumer="Relay Control", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT)

   # Define watering function
   def water_plants():
       print("Soil is dry, starting pump...")
       relay_line.set_value(1)
       time.sleep(5)  # Watering duration (adjust as needed)
       relay_line.set_value(0)
       print("Stopping pump.")

   try:
       while True:
           # Read soil moisture level (0 = dry, 1 = wet)
           soil_dry = not soil_moisture_line.get_value()
           if soil_dry:
               water_plants()
           else:
               print("Soil is moist, no watering needed.")
           time.sleep(60)  # Check moisture every 60 seconds
   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       print("Exiting program.")
   finally:
       relay_line.set_value(0)  # Ensure pump is off
       chip.close()
   ```

### 5. **Run the Program**
   Run your Python script to initiate the automatic watering system:
   ```bash
   python3 watering_system_visionfive2.py
   ```

### 6. **Adjustments and Considerations**
   - **Watering Duration**: Adjust `time.sleep(5)` in the `water_plants()` function based on your plants’ needs.
   - **Moisture Check Interval**: Modify `time.sleep(60)` in the main loop to change the frequency of soil checks.

This will allow the VisionFive 2 to monitor soil moisture and water your flowers automatically.
